# What are robots ?

Robots are rigid/soft bodies that are actuated by gears and electronics, they mainly are dangerous for humans(physically and socialy), but sometimes usefull.

A robot is blind by essence, and if you want to work near them you have two options:
- forbid any contact with humans, create a robot Workcell with doors and walls, if an human enter the reachability of the robot cut all power sources. Easier to put in pratice and mainly used in industry. 
    - also known as OFFLINE Robot Programming.
- Use extereoceptive sensors (vision, laser beams, ultrasonic, torque...) to sense the environnment and use robot at low speed (low kinetic energy level). Harder to put in practice (active research).
    - also known as ONLINE Robotics. 

In any of the two cases you can use robotics concepts such as "path planning", "robot control", "robot perception", "robot decision taking" ... And choose what is best for your use case.

# Reasons I decided to start blogging
This website / blog as for me several objectives:

- force myself writting down and have good projects habits, archiving/versionning ...
    - I lost data of lot of projects i ran and for the leftovers it's useless (no documentation).
    - I was not really involved in finishing properly things because no one would judge it.
    - The stupidest projects, are somethimes the hardest.
- Gain time / efficiency when, writting things in pure text (markdown, rst, TeX).
    - I am tired rewritting things and loosing time on differents formats. I am now a proud user of [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and plain text formats.
- Communicate with others on my various platforms.
    - to date: linkeding / github (empty yet) / others.
- Showcase my knowledge and share thoughts with people.
    - For recruiting processes
    - For Open Source projects
